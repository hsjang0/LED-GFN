# Learning Energy Decompositions for Partial Inference in GFlowNets

This is an official implementation of our paper **Learning Energy Decompositions for Partial Inference in GFlowNets (LED-GFN)** accepted at **ICLR 2024 (oral)**. 


## Repository Overview
We provide the PyTorch implementation for LED-GFN framework here. Our implementations are based on prior studies:

- led_gfn-Bengio (**molecule**): The code is based on [https://github.com/ling-pan/FL-GFN](https://github.com/ling-pan/FL-GFN)
- led_gfn-Shen (**bag and rna sequence**): The code is based on [https://github.com/maxwshen/gflownet](https://github.com/maxwshen/gflownet)
- led_gfn-Zhang (**maximum independent set**): The code is based on [https://github.com/zdhNarsil/GFlowNet-CombOpt](https://github.com/zdhNarsil/GFlowNet-CombOpt)
