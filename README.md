# Learning Energy Decompositions for Partial Inference in GFlowNets

This is an official implementation of our paper **Learning Energy Decompositions for Partial Inference in GFlowNets (LED-GFN)** accepted at **ICLR 2024 (oral)**. 

**Note: Repository is currently being organized**

## Repository Overview
We provide the PyTorch implementation for LED-GFN framework here. The repository is organized as follows:

```python
|-- {led-gfn-Bengio, led-gfn-Shen, led-gfn-Zhang} # implementations of LED-GFN on various tasks
```

- led-gfn-Bengio: The code is based on [https://github.com/GFNOrg/gflownet/tree/master/mols](https://github.com/GFNOrg/gflownet/tree/master/mols)
